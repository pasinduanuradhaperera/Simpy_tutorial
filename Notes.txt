-SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. 
-It's used for modeling and simulating systems where events occur at discrete points in time. 
-This can include things like queues, traffic systems, or any scenario where you want to 
    model the flow of events over time.

Key Concepts in SimPy

Environment:

The core object in SimPy is the Environment. It handles the simulation time and schedules events.
You create an Environment instance to start the simulation.

Processes:

In SimPy, processes represent entities that perform actions over time.
Processes are implemented as Python generators and use yield to wait for events.
Processes are defined using the @simpy.process decorator.

Events:

Events are objects that represent something that happens at a specific point in time.
Common events include Timeout, Event, and Store (used for resource management).

Resources:

Resources manage access to shared resources in a simulation, such as a server or a machine.
Resources are defined with classes like Resource, PriorityResource, and Container.
